- Lessons learned:
  - Try to do changes more incrementally, so that number of compile errors is
    more manageable.
  - Make sure that any API changes are propagated fully.
  - Always use brackets to make things 100% clear.
  - Make sure to use = and == correctly.
  - Make sure to use . and -> correctly for structs and pointers.
  - Make sure tree->size gets updated properly.
